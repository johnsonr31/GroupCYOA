  <h1>CYOA: Graduation Day</h1>

  <hr>

    alt="A photo of a group of graduating students tossing their caps in the air. The people in the photo are in shadow, as the sunset is behind them.">

  <p>You have just graduated from a well-respected space academy. At the space academy, you and the other students who
    were enrolled there were being prepared to work on mining vessels that will harvest rare minerals on distant
    planets. You and the other graduates will be forming teams to go out on these ships, and hopefully to bring back
    plenty of those rare minerals.</p>

  <p>As you try to decide which team you will join, you see some of your friends nearby having formed a team. You worked
    with them pretty well during your time at the academy, though most of you didn't remember everything that you would
    need to do for the ships in case it got seriously damaged. It would probably have been a good idea to study more.
    Though, as long as you don't run into any serious problems, that probably wouldn't be an issue, right?</p>

  <p>Though, you also notice another team of graduates. You recognize them as being some of the top of the class, who
    studied the most out of the other graduates. If something does end up going wrong, they would most likely know what
    to do in that situation. Though, you notice that some of them are bickering and arguing right now, and it doesn't
    seem like they generally get along. Hopefully that won't cause any problems for their team in the future&#8230;</p>

  <p>Both teams would have advantages and disadvantages, though you can only join one of them. Which one will you
    choose?</p>
