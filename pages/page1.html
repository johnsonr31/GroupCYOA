    <h1>Graduation Day</h1>

    <p>You have just graduated from a well-respected space academy. At the space academy, you and the other students who
      were enrolled there were being prepared to work on mining vessels that will harvest rare minerals on distant
      planets. You and the other graduates will be put into teams who will be sent out on these ships.</p>
  
    <p>As you decide what you will do, you see some of your friends nearby having formed a team. You worked with them
      pretty well during your time at the academy, though most of you didn't remember everything that you would need to do
      on the ships. That probably wouldn't be too much of a problem, though.</p>
  
    <p>Though, you also notice another team of graduates. You recognized them as being some of the top of the class, who
      studied the most out of the other graduates. If something did end up going wrong, they would most likely know what
      to do in that situation. Though, you notice that some of them are bickering and arguing right now, and it doesn't
      seem like they generally get along. Hopefully that won't get in the way of anything.</p>
  
    <p>Though, either way, you have a choice of which team you can choose to go with:</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="./pages/page1.html">Your friends, who work well together but didn't study as much.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="">The top graduates, who studied much more, but don't seem to work together as well.</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
