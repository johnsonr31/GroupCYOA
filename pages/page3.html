  <h1>Allow Your Team To Split Up And Try To Fix Stuff!</h1>

  <hr>
  <br>

  <p> Your team has gone their own ways attempting to resolve the issues that have arisen on your ship. Unfortunately,
    you all end up making matters worse. One of your teammates electrocutes themselves, while another
    doesn't follow proper safety procedure and drifts off into space.</p>
  <br>
  <p> The ship is in shambles as your team falls apart before your very eyes. Should have joined that smart team..
