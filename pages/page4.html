  <p>As the issues with the ship continue to get worse, you notice something that you recognize a bit in the issues.
    After asking some of the other team members, you realize that all of you know a few details which might help, though
    the details aren't as useful without being used together.</p>

  <p>You and the others begin using what you all know to begin repairing the ship's damages. Soon, the ship has been
    fully repaired, and the danger has been averted! Everyone is relieved to see that they will survive the trip, and
    the ship continues heading to its destination. Hopefully there won't be too many more issues that arise after
    this&#8230;</p>

  <p>When you and your team ran into issues with the ship, you managed to put what you knew together and solve it to
    avoid a horrible tragedy.</p>
