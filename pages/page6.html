  <br>
  <p> You have decided to join up with the group composed of the smartest students of the academy. Properly preparing by
    doing a walk around and inspection of the ship, you all get ready to board the ship and take off to the great unknown,
    space! </p>
  <br>
  <p> As you all fulfill your duties and ensure protocol is followed as intended, a couple members of the group are
    bickering as to who should be elected leader of the group. Each of them have different plans for how to successfully
    complete your first official mission and can't come to an agreement. </p>
