  <h1>Bad Ending: Aggressive Teamwork</h1>

  <p>The rest of the team continues to butt heads with each other. In frustration, you take charge and aggressively
    convince them to start working together. The others are clearly not fond of the way you are harshly forcing them to
    comply, but they go along with it.</p>

  <p>This seems to work well at first, as the rest of the team begins working together nicely. However, they begin to
    act rather aggressive and hostile towards you, even if they are working together much better now. The ship then
    makes a stop on a small planet, which isn't the one your ship was meant to head to. Before you can question the rest
    of the team, you find yourself being thrown out of the ship, which then flies away!</p>

  <p>While you succeeded in convincing the team to work together, your methods weren't great, and you accidentally
    convinced the team to work together against you&#8230;</p>
