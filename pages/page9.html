  <p> The team is brought together in a circle and you mediate the issue of leadership the group is facing. It is a good
    thing you took those communication and sociology classes in college! Everyone sits down including the member vying
    for leadership in the first place. </p>

  <p> Realizing their are underlying issues each member is dealing with, you provide everyone an opportunity to talk.
    Once everyone has gone and spoke their truth you come up with a solution where their is no need for a leader, you
    are all a council of leaders and can work together after all! You hug it out and think of how dumb it was that you
    all were going to fight over it in the first place! </p>

  <p> Your team makes it home after a successful trip retrieving all sorts of rare and precious minerals! You
    are all awarded badges of merit and are on your ways to becoming the space explorers you always dreamed!
    Congratulations on a job well done! </p>
